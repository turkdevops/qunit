`notDeepEqual( actual, expected, message = "" )`

An inverted deep recursive comparison, working on primitive types, arrays, objects, regular expressions, dates and functions.

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| `actual` | Expression being tested |
| `expected` | Known comparison value |
| `message` (string) | A short description of the assertion |

This is the inverse of [`assert.deepEqual()`](./deepEqual.md).

## Examples

Compare the value of two objects.

```js
QUnit.test( "example", assert => {
  const result = { foo: "yep" };

  // succeeds, objects are similar but have a different foo value.
  assert.notDeepEqual( result, { foo: "nope" } );
});
```
